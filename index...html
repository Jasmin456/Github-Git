<p>To start of I would love to write about Persian food. A country and a culture that stands very close to my heart, because my parents are from Iran. A wide food culture consisting everything from meat dishes to dishes containing nuts and berrys. </p> 

<p>The second food culture I would like to write about is Lebanese food, a kitchen that has never disappointed me. At least at the restaurants I ate their food at. With a wide vegetarian selection, their kitchen will probably always be one of my favorites. A Lebanese restaurant that I would like to recommend is a restaurant called "Underbar" in Stockholm. </p>

<p> The last kitchen I would like to write about is the Mexican kitchen. If I had to describe the Mexican kitchen with only three words, it would be:</p>
</body> <li>Spicy</li>
<li>Creamy</li>
<li>Wonderful</li>
<p>Some of their traditionall dishes are "Burritos, tamales and quasadillas". I donÂ´t think that I will ever get tired of their food.</p>
